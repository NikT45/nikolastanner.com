    "description": "Growing up I loved playing competitive shooters like Counter Strike and R6. When I came to college I left my PC in China and don't really play those games anymore. Clash Royale satisfies my itch for competitive gaming and also connects me with a friend overseas which is really nice. It's one of the very few games I find competitive enough while still being playable over different regions with high ping, and from an engineering perspective it is a great game made by a great studio."

I practically had a jewelry making studio in the living room. I now have random understanding of annealing metals, soldering, and pickling things like 925 silver. See images [here](/images)."
